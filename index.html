    <div class = "about">
      <p>3.5 billion to 7 billion trees are cut down annually. Why does this matter you may ask? As a result of these trees being removed, both animals and humans are negatively impacted. Both animals and native peoples rely on the forest as their habitats, forcing millions to relocate annually due to deforestation. Deforestation contributes to another major problem on the rise, known as climate change. Climate change has the ability to cause irreversible damage to our planet and eventually lead to mass destruction. Deforestation is additionally correlated with higher rates of forest fires, increasing carbon emissions and causing even further damage to our forests.
